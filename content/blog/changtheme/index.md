I have changed the look of this website.  I am still working on some of the pages like the contact page and I will be adding a new copy and paste.  So you can easily copy and paste the code from this website.  The look will be changing a little bit.  

I am also working on finishing a youtube video on how to use syncthing.  I will probably add some documentation on it here also.

I also working on finishing up the video about my transferring to a  1u case. I can't wait for you to see it and learn from my mistakes.
