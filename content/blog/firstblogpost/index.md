Welcome to my first blog post on Computer Hacking 101 website.  The blogs are going to be telling you what we are working on and trying to get done with the youtube channel and this website. First, we just replace WordPress with Hugo for this site and my personal website located at <https://chrisallen.us>.    I am using Hugo for this website because it is a more modern and powerful website builder.  We haven't got the final design of the website done yet so you might see changes to the website for a while.  

I am hoping to get the next video about syncthing which is titled "How to use Syncthing" in a couple of weeks. I also got a 1u server case I am going to move my Promox server into.  I am planning on doing a video on that also.

The videos will come out slowly because I have a full-time job right now.  I also have to spend some time with my family and friends.
