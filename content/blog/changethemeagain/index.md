I decided to change the theme again.  The theme change adds more features, including copy and paste, and the search feature will work.  I will be making a video on this soon.  I set it up so my Jenkins site will make a docker container containing the website using nginx.  So it is easy to deploy.  I am still working on making it automatically deploy when I add a new page.  I still have to go into Portainer manually, redeploy it, go to Cloudflare, and clear the catch.  

This website has kept me busy, so I still need to finish the youtube videos.  Once I get a few more bugs fixed on this website, I can start making youtube videos again.
